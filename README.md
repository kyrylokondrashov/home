My very own personal website. Basically this is just a résumé. 

Hello. This is my test-project for Binary Academy. For this task, I decided to make a resume on my favourite game character —
witcher Geralt from Rivia. I decided to host on GitHub Pages, because it is easy and free. 
While working on this resume, I used HTML, a template for timetable, jQuery and Semantic UI framework. Hope you will like it!
